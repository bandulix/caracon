# What is caracon?
With this small project, a traditional caravan heater will be upgraded to automatic control via touch interface.
## Requirements
As the system works in a caravan, where temperatures above 50°C can easily be reached, the solution should work without a raspberry pi. This means none of the existing smart home solutions are used. Beside this, the if the solution is not used or working, the heaters should still work like they normally do. The temperature should be measured at a central point in the caravan and temperature profiles should be available, like lower temps during night. 
## Hardware
The heater is standard for our Caravan Knaus Südwind
