# Introduction
With this small project, a traditional caravan heater will be upgraded to automatic control via touch interface. The hardware is a Truma S5004 together with a Truma Ultraheat. The Ultraheat is a 230V electric heating device, which can easily be controlled via a smart switch, like the Shelly Plus. The gas heater S5004 has a analog thermostat, which is controlled via a small workaround (Tutorial: ).
